We also introduced some programming concepts such as loops and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will build on the programming skills that you acquired in the first tutorial. Specifically, we will cover concepts that are the nuts and bolts of programming in any language: loops, decisions and functions.\n",

Luckily there's a function you can call on a pandas dataframe that makes a dataframe into a list-like thing that you can feed into a 'for' loop. It's called `iterrows()`, and it returns 2 things, the index of the row and the data from the row itself. This slightly changes the way we declare the 'for' loop. Instead of having only one thing between the 'for' and 'in' (such as `for f in friends_list:`), we have two things seperated by a comma, the first one gets the index, and the second one gets the row data."
